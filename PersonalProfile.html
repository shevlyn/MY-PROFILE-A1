<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3>
<p>All of these Test results certainly state a lot of information that I agree with. The 16 personalities test is so accurate as I been given the executive personality trait which briefly is someone who is extraverted, observant, thinking and judging. Represented as an individual of tradition and quality of following my own judgement. This could not be said any better as I am definitely someone who stands her ground and take pride in taking a stand for what I believe is right. As I continued analysing the results, this test summed up my personality in the best possible way. The big 5 personality test results review 5 factors which is extroversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness and intellect/imagination. My results here were quite agreeable to except the fact that I rank high with my conscientiousness as I am not really as organised as I wish to be and am certainly struggling with time management skills. As these two tests represent personality traits, I have gathered that I am a very goal driven individual, focused and dedicated to achieving what I want. The third quiz identifies different learning styles, and which one is more suitable to me. According to the results. I am more of the activist style and not much of a pragmatist, which is true at a certain extent as I am interested and up for discussions however, I would get bored and lose patience in long conversations.  </p>

    <h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
    <p>According to these results it may mean that I might be very dominating or organising in a team and initially taking something like the lead role. So that things go a certain way and an extrovert personality promotes a friendly social life so I would want to connect with others for advancement. It also demonstrates that I could lose patience for laziness and definitely people who show off or think that they are better than others. In a team it is positive if you receive criticism from others and work on it for the better. As I am more of an activist and theorist learner, I am assuming that for effective teamwork results, it would best suit me to discuss solutions with the group and work with texts such quotes and stories. I think that results may influence my behaviour in a team as someone who works hard to achieve the desired results.</p>

    <h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
    <p>When forming a group, I think It would be best if I work with similar, determined individuals. However, different personalities in a team also has its benefits as everyone balances each other out. For instance, if everyone in the group is an extrovert, who are loud and outgoing, the whole team could be a mess but, in some cases, it depends as some people know how to balance their social and work life. In the team if I am someone who demonstrates activist and theorist learning style, then it is vital for other members of the team to demonstrate reflector and pragmatist style. This will not only be beneficial to have people working on different things in a variety of ways, but it is crucial for the results of work as you get a different perspective from other learning styles.</p>
